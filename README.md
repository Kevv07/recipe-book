# recipe-book
A recipe book application made while learning Angular. Also is my first time working with a little bit of back-end, sorry

first of all, the recipes are hosted in a firebase database and you'll need to fetch them, to do so, you must login or signup with an email, then you can fetch the recipe data. 
with said data, you can edit recipes or create new ones and you can save them directly on the database.

if you dont want to login, you can create new recipes but you will not be able to save it.
